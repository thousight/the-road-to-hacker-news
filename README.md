# The Road to Learn React follow through
Going through [The Road to Learn React](https://github.com/the-road-to-learn-react/the-road-to-learn-react) and get the hands on code stored at this repo

### Things I do differently from the book
- The book kinda put everything together into App.jsx, while I divided up the components into files and put some strings into a singleton
- Some function names are different, for example, fetchSearchTopStories() in App.jsx is called handleHackerNewsFetch() in my case
- In the pagination API search section of the book, it uses a button to fetch more items, while I used [react-visibility-sensor](https://github.com/joshwnj/react-visibility-sensor) to enable infinite scroll instead. And because of this change, I got rid of the API fetch call at componentDidMount() because react-visibility-sensor will call it at render()
- I use [react-toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify) to notify user when error happens instead of dismissing the list in the tutorial
- The tutorial teaches us to sort hits in front end, it's useful in other scenarios but I personally think it's a bad idea in this case because it can be inconsistent as the API fetches new data. For example, I now have a sorted list by title, and the list ends with an article starting with character 'z', but when I fetch new data, the API call is not configured to be sorted, therefore the results I fetched will include titles starting with other charcters, and the article with title starts with 'z' will still be at the end of the list, while other new results will be on the upper positions of the list, causing the user to be less likely to see them because he/she scrolled down for new data but they went up instead. So what I do differently, in this case, is configure sorting on the API call instead.
